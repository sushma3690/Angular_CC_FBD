TypeScript
Benefits:
Clean structure
Lots of resuable code - user navigation and browser histry
Apps are more testable

software req:
install node;
npm install -> to download all 3 party libraries
npm install -g @angular/cli -> g -> makes it global else it will install only in the current directory.

my:
node-14.4
angular-10.0.1

ng serve -> node server listening on port 4200

Angular Projects Structure::

e2e: for end to end testing - like user simulation - navigating to our app on brower, login, butoon click, filling out form and such behaviors.

node_modules -> all 3rd party libraries are downloaded here and its purely for dev purposes. in production required depencies are bundled along with the app
and released for production

src -> the folder having source code.
src/
/ app -> every app has atleast one module and one component
/assets -> static assets like images, text files, etc.,
/environments - config files like one for dev, other for production
/fav.ico -> tab image in broswer
/index.html -> it doesnt have any dirct references to angilar but content is laoded into index html dynamically
/main.ts -> equivalent to main program in java -> bootstraps the main agular AppModule, and thats where from where it all starts
/polyfill.js -> features of JS that angular needs but nt supported by brser -> hacks
/style.css -> global styles file - can have individual ones at component level too
/test.ts -> writing test cases - for setting up test config

.editorconfig -> if dveelpong angular proj as a team then this is needed so that all dvlopers have same config for their editors used in develpoment
.gitignore - same like in eclipse/ any git proj
karma.conf.js - testing -> config file for karma which test runner for Angular app
package.json -> all dependcies for the proj along with their versions;;; depen , dev depen(karma)
protractor.config.js -> end to end JS app
tsconfig -> u mention some props that u wnt when converting from typescript to javascript
tslint.json-> config file fot tlint -> equivalent to sonarqube - tslint checks your codes readability, maintainbilty etc.,

Webpack :: the moment a change is nade in any file - html, css or js then webpack immediately compiles and does a hot deploy. the changes r 
seen on the browser without a rfresh -> the things that r mainly compiled n bundled r pollyfills, styles, vendor and one more.
ang 4 - no way to change the bundle name .

all the css is compiled into js bundle - styles bundle

Angular versions::
diff angular core libs - @angular/core 2.x, compiler 2.x, http 2.x , router 3; to main all versions same going forward- angular went straight to 4 from 3

TypeScript::

Superset of JS
Any valid JS code is valid TS
Once we TS on exdcution it converts TS to JS(transpiled TS to JS)
String static typing -> catch errors at compile time than runtime

npm install -g typescript - 3.9.6

access modifiers - applied on variables , methods:

private -> cant be accesed by anyone outsside
public -> by default
protected

access modifers in construct eliminates the need to i itialize variables or even assign them, its taken care the moment
u put access modifer before the variable in constructr - variable wuth same name is created and initialized internally by TS

prop looks like a variable and used like a variable but really is a method isndie the class - cpuld be  a getter and setter or either of them

modules - export, import in diff files


Section2::

Components - Data + HTML + View

1 udemy app-> 1 big component or many small components that can be used in different applications too
1 udemy app -> nav bar component, side bar component, course component, rating component (probably rating component can be used in movies app too)
every angular app has 1 component called root component
every angular app has 1 component called root component
Module -> every angular app has 1 component, it can jave more than 1 but related components too
udemy app potential components -> courses, messaging, instrctr, admin

Components::

create a component
registr with a module
write markup

easily can be done using -> ng g c course -> creates component n updates app module

*ngFor;;;

* shul be used before any directive that modifes the dom - either add or delete

export class CourseComponent{
    title="List of Courses";
    courses=["c1","c2","c3"]; //http-> tightly coupled and same http has to be repeated; hence service

    getTitle(){
        return this.title;
    }

}

Services: forcommon reusable code that can be shared across components.

new Service();;; tight coupling
constructr(service: Srvice);; and in module providers[Srvice];;; will instantiate and assign it to object var declaed in constrt of component
- loose coupling

Service - 1 instance - even when used by 100 componenets

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({ //if heres a dependency in servc constrctr it tells angular to inject those; for Component @Component a;teady has injectable inside it
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class EmailService {

  constructor() { }
}

String interpolation+ prop biinding - both are one way binding from component to view
String interpolation for text in headings divs or paras
property binding where string interpolation bcomes too long and annoying
